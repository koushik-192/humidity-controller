# Components used:
## Arduino Uno:

 The Arduino Uno is a small and easy-to-use computer called a microcontroller board. It is used to build electronic projects like temperature monitors, robots, or automatic lights. It helps you control different electronic parts like sensors, motors, or LEDs.
Arduino Uno is popular because it is cheap, easy to learn, and has a large community to help you. There are lots of tutorials and examples online. It also works with many sensors and electronic parts, so you can build many types of projects.

## 5V DC, 108kHz Mist Maker:

 A mist maker or humidifier module is a small device that turns water into cool mist. It uses ultrasonic vibrations to create the mist. This one works with 5 volts DC, which makes it safe and easy to use with small electronics or USB power.
The mist maker vibrates very fast — at a frequency of 108 kHz (108,000 times per second). These vibrations break the water into tiny droplets, which look like fog or mist. It does this without using any heat.

## 5v Relay:

 A 5V relay is an electronic switch. It allows you to turn ON or OFF a device (like a bulb, fan, or humidifier) using a small signal from a microcontroller like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any 5V system.
The relay has a coil inside. When it gets 5V from the Arduino or another controller, the coil activates. This closes a switch inside the relay, which can turn another device ON or OFF, even one using a higher voltage (like 12V or 230V AC).

## DHT11 sensor:

 The DHT11 is a small sensor that can measure temperature and humidity. It is often used in beginner electronics and Arduino projects. It is low-cost and easy to use.
The sensor sends this data as a digital signal, so it’s easy for an Arduino or other microcontroller to read.

## I2C LCD Display:

 An I2C LCD display is a screen used to show text or numbers in Arduino and electronics projects. It’s just like a regular LCD, but with an I2C adapter on the back, which makes wiring easier.
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a communication method that lets the Arduino talk to the LCD using just two wires SDA (data line) & SCL (clock line). This saves space compared to regular LCDs that need many wires.

## Jumper wires:

Jumper wires are small, flexible wires used to connect different components in electronic projects, especially on a breadboard or with an Arduino. They allow you to quickly build and test circuits without the need for soldering. Jumper wires come in three main types: male-to-male, male-to-female, and female-to-female. Each type is used depending on what kind of connection you need — for example, connecting two pins on a breadboard or linking a sensor to an Arduino.
