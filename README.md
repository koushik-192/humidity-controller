The Humidity Controller Mini Project is an Arduino-based system that automatically monitors and controls humidity levels. Using Arduino Uno, DHT11 sensor, and relay-controlled mist maker, it maintains a preset humidity level and displays real-time data on an LCD. It is a low cost solution ideal for mushroom cultivation and greenhouse applications.
